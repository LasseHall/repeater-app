# Repeater App

The Repeater App creates a repeatable list of key-value pairs. Key-value pairs are two pieces of associated information such as:

-   Ingredients list (Flour, 500 grams)
-   Item variations and amount in stock (T-Shirt, 5 left)
-   Statistics (Color variation, 5%)

The Repeater app utilizes the Contentful JSON Field to store a simple `Item` data stucture:

```ts
{
    id: string; // automatically generated by the app
    name: string;
    value: string;
}
```

*Note that the `id` property is automatically generated and useful for developers
to differentiate between different list items even if the labels are the same or similar*

An example item in the Contentful response:

```json
{
    "fields": {
        "ingredientsList": [
            {
                "id": "fisgh9s8e-sdfhap832",
                "name": "Flour",
                "value": "500g"
            },
            {
                "id": "asd7f82eiSUHDU-F0sudh4",
                "name": "salt",
                "value": "10g"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
### Looking to use reference fields?
[Martin's Contentful Reference Matrix Field App](https://github.com/mgschoen/contentful-reference-matrix-field-app) is a continuation of this simple Repeater App
but uses the Contentful [Reference Fields](https://www.contentful.com/help/references/)
as a data source.
## To Learn More: Live Stream of the Prototyping of This App

On November 24th, 2020, Stefan and I did a live stream event where we built the prototype
for this app as a way to show developers the uses of the App Framework.

## For Developers: Running This App Locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Creates or updates your app definition in contentful, and runs the app in development mode.
Open your app to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Libraries to use

To make your app look and feel like Contentful use the following libraries:

-   [Forma 36](https://f36.contentful.com/) – Contentful's design system
-   [Contentful Field Editors](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/field-editors/) – Contentful's field editor React components
